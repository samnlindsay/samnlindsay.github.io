{% include gallery id="moon_gallery" caption="A few of my photographs of a lunar eclipse taken from Alexandra Palace. These were later used on the BBC News website, and shown behind me live on screen in one of my several media interviews about the '[super blood moon](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3246483/How-watch-SUPERMOON-eclipse-Rare-phenomenon-seen-world-weekend-say-spell-end-world.html)' for the BBC News TV channel. My [full eclipse photo](https://500px.com/photo/123272665/Alexandra-Palace-Angel-by-Sam-Lindsay/?utm_source=iso.500px.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=embed&utm_content=web) also featured in some other media outlets, adding to what was by far the busiest 24 hours of my media career." %}
