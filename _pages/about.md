## Introduction

I am a data scientist at the [Ministry of Justice](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice), where I have worked in the **Data Science & Personalisation Hub** since 2017. Working in a large government department, I have had the privilege of presenting my work directly to Ministers and High Court Judges, reporting on a wide variety of subject areas including:
- forecasting demand in the Crown Court system
- quantifying regional variation in Family Court cases concerning children (see [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/696108/children-in-family-justice-data-share.pdf))
- analysing text responses to public consultations
  
As well as this diverse subject matter, I have benefited from the opportunity to learn new skills and develop myself, working mainly in R, Python and SQL, and producing data visualisations and webapps in Tableau and R Shiny. Coming from a background in academic research, almost all of these skills have been developed on the job, working in a like-minded team with a range of experience and supportive environment for learning (as well as the top-notch technical offering from the MoJ's [Analytical Platform](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/about.html#content)).

Currently, I am one of three data scientists comprising the _Internal Data Linking_ team for the [_Data First_](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ministry-of-justice-data-first) project, funded by [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/our-work/browse-all-projects/data-first-harnessing-the-potential-of-linked-administrative-data-for-the-justice-system-169/). This project involves linking individuals within and between the variety of large administrative datasets held by the Ministry of Justice and its executive agencies, for internal analysis, further linking with other government departments, and the sharing of linked datasets with academic researchers. 

To achieve this task and assist other organisations in similar work, we have developed our own open-source data linking software [**_Splink_**](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/joined-up-data-in-government-the-future-of-data-linking-methods/splink-mojs-open-source-library-for-probabilistic-record-linkage-at-scale). This work earned the team an [Analysis in Government Award for Innovation in 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/launch-of-the-analysis-in-government-awards) and we continue to improve Splink and promote its use across government and beyond.

After completing my PhD at the University of Hertfordshire, I continued my research into radio galaxies and the large-scale structure of the Universe at the University of Oxford. For more on my brief academic career, head to my [Astrophysics](/astro) page.

Passing up an SKA Research Fellowship at the University of Western Cape in South Africa, I stayed in the UK and joined the Royal Astronomical Society as Assistant Editor and Deputy Press Officer, working in academic publishing and media. 

After two years, however, I went back to my analytical roots and began a new career in the civil service as a data scientist at the MoJ in April 2017.

| *May 2015 - April 2017* | **Assistant Editor & Deputy Press Officer** | Royal Astronomical Society |
| *May 2014 - May 2015* | **Postdoctoral Research Assistant** | University of Oxford |

Other work has included private tuition of 10-19 year-olds, tutoring University of Hertfordshire undergraduates in mathematics, and part-time work as a personal trainer and duty manager at David Lloyd Leisure.
