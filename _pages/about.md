I am a data scientist at the [Ministry of Justice](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice). As part of the **Data Science & Personalisation Hub** in a large government department, I have worked in R, python and SQL, while producing data visualisations and webapps in Tableau and R Shiny, covering a range of subject areas including:
- forecasting criminal court demand
- assessing regional variation of Family Court cases concerning children (see [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/696108/children-in-family-justice-data-share.pdf))
- analysing text responses to public consultations

Currently, I am part of the Internal Data Linking team for the [_Data First_](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ministry-of-justice-data-first) project, funded by [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/our-work/browse-all-projects/data-first-harnessing-the-potential-of-linked-administrative-data-for-the-justice-system-169/). This work involves linking a variety of large datasets from Criminal Courts to Family Courts to Prisons and Probation, and developing our own open-source data linking software [**_Splink_**](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/joined-up-data-in-government-the-future-of-data-linking-methods/splink-mojs-open-source-library-for-probabilistic-record-linkage-at-scale)

## Background

After completing my PhD at the University of Hertfordshire, I continued my research into radio galaxies and the large-scale structure of the Universe at the University of Oxford. Passing up an SKA Research Fellowship at the University of Western Cape in South Africa, I stayed in the UK and joined the Royal Astronomical Society as Assistant Editor and Deputy Press Officer, working in academic publishing and media. After two years, however, I went back to my analytical roots and began a new career in the civil service as a data scientist at the MoJ in April 2017. 

Away from work, I enjoys photography, playing rugby union for Ealing Trailfinders 1871 as 2nd Team Captain, and not referring to himself in the third person.
