## Introduction

I am a data scientist at the [Ministry of Justice](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice), where I have worked in the **Data Science & Personalisation Hub** since 2017. Working in a large government department, I have had the privilege of presenting my work directly to Ministers and High Court Judges, reporting on a wide variety of subject areas including:
- forecasting demand in the Crown Court system
- quantifying regional variation in Family Court cases concerning children (see [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/696108/children-in-family-justice-data-share.pdf))
- analysing text responses to public consultations
  
As well as this diverse subject matter, I have benefited from the opportunity to learn new skills and develop myself, working mainly in R, Python and SQL, and producing data visualisations and webapps in Tableau and R Shiny. Coming from a background in academic research, almost all of these skills have been developed on the job, working in a like-minded team with a range of experience and supportive environment for learning (as well as the top-notch technical offering from the MoJ's [Analytical Platform](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/about.html#content)).

Currently, I am one of three data scientists comprising the _Internal Data Linking_ team for the [_Data First_](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ministry-of-justice-data-first) project, funded by [ADR UK](https://www.adruk.org/our-work/browse-all-projects/data-first-harnessing-the-potential-of-linked-administrative-data-for-the-justice-system-169/). This project involves linking individuals within and between the variety of large administrative datasets held by the Ministry of Justice and its executive agencies, for internal analysis, further linking with other government departments, and the sharing of linked datasets with academic researchers. 

To achieve this task and assist other organisations in similar work, we have developed our own open-source data linking software [**_Splink_**](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/joined-up-data-in-government-the-future-of-data-linking-methods/splink-mojs-open-source-library-for-probabilistic-record-linkage-at-scale). This work earned the team an [Analysis in Government Award for Innovation in 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/launch-of-the-analysis-in-government-awards) and we continue to improve Splink and promote its use across government and beyond.

After completing my PhD at the University of Hertfordshire, I continued my research into radio galaxies and the large-scale structure of the Universe at the University of Oxford. For more on my brief academic career, head to my [Astrophysics](/astro) page.

Passing up an SKA Research Fellowship at the University of Western Cape in South Africa, I stayed in the UK and joined the Royal Astronomical Society as Assistant Editor and Deputy Press Officer, working in academic publishing and media. 

After two years, however, I went back to my analytical roots and began a new career in the civil service as a data scientist at the MoJ in April 2017.

I currently live in Charlton with my wife Issi, a Metropolitan Police Officer. While our professional lives revolve around crime, we both enjoy rugby and lifting weights at the gym. Aside from that, we are pretty much opposites - a quiet, scientist from the city and a convivial, country girl with a Music & Drama degree. 

I grew up in Wembley (the "[home of English football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley)") in North West London -- ironic given my favourite sport has been rugby since I was about 11 years old. I was always a bit of a nerd (no surprises there), and while I always had a healthy involvement in sport (football, rugby, judo, tennis) I was never particularly good or passionate about them. 

#### Music 
My teens were dominated by music, playing guitar and bass before I settled on the drums and joined a punk band at school. Not quite popular enough for our fellow pupils to take notice at the school's Battle of the Bands (we defied convention and played original material), we thrived in the "alternative" scene we found in the wider world. Going to gigs at [The Underworld, Camden](https://www.theunderworldcamden.co.uk/) in the evenings, playing acoustic guitars in school corridors at lunchtimes, and then band practice on Sundays made a wholesome enough timetable to keep me out of too much trouble. Thankfully, I'm old enough that "_The Outer Limits_" and our pretentious middle-class teenage ska punk seems to have disappeared into the aether with all the other early-2000s Myspace profiles and Geocities websites.

</figure>

#### Rowing
After my A-levels I got my first job, in the bar/restaurant at my local David Lloyd Leisure club which came with free gym membership. Within a year, I had suddenly found my athletic side and convinced the gym manager to pay for my course to qualify as a personal trainer - better pay, more comfortable uniform and getting people fit instead of serving them coffee. 

With this newfound fitness (and being 6'5" tall) I was encouraged to try out rowing at the prestigious [Imperial College Boat Club](https://www.imperialboatclub.co.uk/). There I finally found a sport that suited me, and a gentle introduction soon escalated, becoming an addiction (how else do you explain the 6am starts and 12 sessions per week, regularly pushing yourself to the point of vomiting). Between university workload, rowing training and still working 2 or 3 nights a week at the gym I was incredibly fit but at the cost of occasionally falling asleep standing upright on a crowded London Underground at rush hour.

After living for a year in the student accommodation above the university boathouse in Putney, I kicked the habit briefly at the start of my final year of undergraduate studies, and then again when I started my PhD. Then a friend from Imperial tempted me back on the water with [Vesta Rowing Club](https://www.vestarowing.co.uk/), just two doors down the Putney Embankment from Imperial. I won fewer medals and trophies, but negotiated a far more relaxed approach to training around my PhD studies and enjoyed the thrill of racing at [Henley Royal Regatta](https://www.hrr.co.uk/) again in 2013.

#### Travels

Having gone to secondary school in nearby Hertfordshire, then Imperial College London as an undergraduate before the University of Hertfordshire as a postgraduate student, I am unashamedly attached to London. It is surprising then that the reason I kicked the rowing habit for good was that I joined the Physics Department of the [University of Oxford](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/) - an institution with a famous rowing tradition.

Before my PhD I had visited a few European countries all within about 2 hours from London, but never caught the "travel bug" urging me to explore the world. My first "work trip" in the name of my PhD was to La Palma, one of the Canary Islands, home to the [Isaac Newton Group](http://www.ing.iac.es/) of telescopes. Given my theoretical physics background, I had steered away from the more observational research projects, so I didn't expect the opportunity to travel to work night shifts on these huge mountain-top telescopes. While technically part of Spain, La Palma is geographically in Africa so I count this as my first time leaving Europe, my first time at altitude (only 2,334m, but enough to notice the thinner air). Coming from London, it was an almost spiritual experience to be above the clouds in a place whose whole purpose is total darkness and incredible views of the stars. Despite being an astrophysicist, I had never been that bothered about actually _looking_ at the sky before. That said, when the clouds do roll in and rise above the observatory, it's not much fun being stuck at the top of a mountain on a nocturnal sleep pattern in bad weather with nothing to do.

  <figcaption>The kind of view you can only get in the middle of nowhere, in the Southern hemisphere.

</figure>

While La Palma was accessible and a useful learning environment for grad students, later in my PhD I had the opportunity to get more involved in the process. I put in the work to assemble a list of targets (telescope time is expensive so you'd better make the most of it on the _best_ galaxies) and then processing all of the raw telescope images ("data reduction"), with the reward being free travel to the [European Southern Observatory](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/lasilla/ntt/) in the Atacama Desert in Chile. 

Aside from the Mars-like terrain, the fascinating array of telescopes, and darker skies than I could comprehend, I was also seeing stars I could never have seen before, even in La Palma. Being in the Southern Hemisphere, I could see the famous [Southern Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux) (seen in the flags of Australia and several other countries) and clear as day, the form of the Milky Way stretching overhead. 

Nothing hits home regarding your place in the Universe like standing in a desert, seeing the centre of your galaxy with your own eyes. My only regrets from this trip are (a) not taking up photography until afterwards, and (b) not making the most of the trip by tacking on a bit of a holiday afterwards. It took 3 flights followed by a 2-hour drive to get to the observatory from London, via Sao Paolo, Santiago and La Serena. For all that travel, the most perfunctory of overnight stays in Santiago was all I enjoyed of South American civilisation -- a guesthouse run by a European organisation.

I made no such mistakes when alerted to a conference in Charlottesville, Virginia in the USA. My first and to-date only trip to North America, I made sure to turn a 2.5 day conference into at least a week away, and armed with my Canon 600D. With travel to and from Charlottesville paid for by my department, I was free to roam in between. Charlottesville is a beautiful town (I refused to call it a city with a population about 6 times less than your average London borough), despite its [recent history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally), but my real goal was to head out of "the South" with its famous hospitality, and take in New York. 

After a bus through Virginia to Washington D.C. (box ticked) and a train to New York, I was on my way to my first booking on Airbnb -- a stranger's spare room in their 4th floor apartment in Washington Heights, just about the furthest you can be from Manhattan while still being in Manhattan. I wasn't even alone in the end, as an old friend from Wembley happened to be in town on holiday, inviting me out with her New York-based model friends. Is travelling the world alone always this easy?

Ranked above all of these places was a place I visited **twice** at no personal expense in the name of postgraduate study -- Cape Town, South Africa. No telescopes this time, just networking and spending more time with my supervisor who was spending 3 months of the year based at the University of Western Cape. After just a week in an apartment at the foot of Table Mountain overlooking the "_Mother City_", I was in love. 

I was lucky enough to visit again for 2 weeks for a cosmology summer school in nearby Stellenbosch. Of course this meant 2 weeks of escaping the UK winter for a 40-degree South African summer, where the exchange rate means even a bunch of students can afford to eat and drink pretty well. 


In a wonderful year living in a beautiful city, with a 10-minute commute by bicycle to work at one of the best universities in the world, I formally graduated with my PhD and
